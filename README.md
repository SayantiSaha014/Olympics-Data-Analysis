# 📜 Introduction

This dataset is a list of all the medal winners in the Summer Olympics from 1976 Montreal to 2008 Beijing. It includes each and every medal awarded within the period. For a project based on Olympics data analysis, the primary focus will be on exploring and understanding the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncovering trends and insights related to athletes, countries, and sports over the years.

We'll use the following columns for our analysis:
 
- **City** : *The city where the Olympics took place.*
- **Year** : *The year of the Olympics.*
- **Sport** : *The sport the event is categorized under.*
- **Discipline** : *A subcategory of the sport.*
- **Event** : *The specific event within a discipline.*
- **Athlete** : *The name of the athlete who participated.*
- **Gender** : *The gender of the athlete.*
- **Country_Code** : *The country code (abbreviation).*
- **Country** : *The full name of the country.*
- **Event_gender** : *The gender category of the event.*
- **Medal** : *The medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze).*
